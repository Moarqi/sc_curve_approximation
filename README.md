Curve Approximation
===================

We want to approximate a set of given constraints `(x_i, y_i)` by a
polynomial curve. The constraints can be defined by clicking with the
left mouse button. Use the key `c` to clear the points. Use
`1` to `6` to try the six test cases (a sine curve with
increasing density). Press `a` and `i` to switch to approximation and
interpolation, respectively. You can use the `spacebar` to switch between
your own LU solver and one provided by [Eigen](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/),
or between your own Cholesky solver, one provided by Eigen, and a QR solver
provided by Eigen -- depending on whether approximation or interpolation
is active.
You can find some typedefs for Eigen's matrices and vectors in `types.h`.
Use `Scalar` for floating point variables and change it's definition in
`types.h` if you want to use `float` instead of `double`.

Building under Linux/MacOS
--------------------------

Inside the exercise's top-level directory, execute the following commands:

    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..
    make

Using Xcode under MacOS
-----------------------

If you prefer to use Xcode on Mac, to the following:

    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake -G Xcode ..

and then open the generated Xcode project.

Building and running under Windows
----------------------------------

* Download and install [Visual Studio Community](https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/community/)
* Make sure that you check "Desktop development with C++" during installation
* Download [cmake](https://cmake.org/download/) via the platform windows .zip version and extract it somewhere
* Create an empty build folder inside the project's top-level directory
* Start cmake-gui.exe (located in cmake's bin folder)
* Specify the top-level directory as source directory (button Browse source...)
* Specify the build folder as build directory (button Browse build...)
* Select Configure using your Visual Studio Version as option.
* When configuration is finished, select Generate.
* Start Visual Studio Community
* Open the project via File -> open -> project -> .sln in build folder
* In the project explorer window on the right, right-click the project (skeletal animation) and set it as startup-project
* Switch to release mode
* The executable will need the character's .bim file and (optional) a motion file as command line arguments. You can specify those via project -> properties -> debugging -> command arguments
* Hit CTRL + F5 to build and run (or CTRL + SHIFT + B to build)


Documentation
-------------

Open the pre-built documentation from within the `build` directory via

    firefox ../doc/index.html

or using any other web browser.

You can also build the HTML documentation on your own as long as you have [Doxygen](www.doxygen.org/) installed. To do so, still inside the directory `build`, execute the following command:

    make doc

View the documentation by opening the file `html/index.html` with any web browser / HTML viewer. If you are into LaTeX, navigate into the directory `latex` and execute the command `make` to create a printable version of the documentation.


Running
-------

After building (i.e. execution of `make`), still in the directory `build`, launch the program by executing the following command:

    ./approximation

Todo
----

* In the file `src/InterpolationViewer.cpp`, implement the function `fit_curve()`. Set up the linear system `A * x = b` and use either your or Eigen's solver to solve the system. Compute the error `||A * x - b||` and compare the two solvers.

* In the file `src/lu.cpp`, implement the `solve()` function that solves `A * x = b` after the factorization `A = L * U` has been computed. Here you have to solve two triangular systems involving `L` and `U`. Finish the function `factorize()` to actually compute the factorization.

* In the file `src/ApproximationViewer.cpp`, implement the function `add_noise()`. Use it to add some noise to the constraints' `y`-coordinates.

* In the file `src/ApproximationViewer.cpp`, implement the function `approximate()`. Set up the overdetermined system and the normal equations, and use Eigen's Cholesky solver or QR solver to compute the least squares solution.

* In the file `src/cholesky.cpp`, implement the `factorize()`. Then, make this solver available as an alternative in `src/ApproximationViewer.cpp`.
